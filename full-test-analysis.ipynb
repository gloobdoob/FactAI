Nauna nang inihayag ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte, na ang Metro Manila ay ilalagay sa ilalim ng GCQ simula Hunyo 1, kasama ang Regions II, III, IV-A, at ang mga lalawigan ng Pangasinan at Albay at ang mga lungsod ng Davao, Baguio, at Iloilo. Samantalang ang Cebu City and Mandaue City, na unang ipinahayag na sasailalim sa modified enhanced community, ay isasama na rin sa mga lugar na sasailalim sa GCQ, kasama ang Region VII at Zamboanga City. Ang natitirang bahagi ng bansa ay sasailalim samodified general community quarantine. \"The administration with its whole-of-government approach has put in place interventions and measures following minimum public health standards to ensure the safety of Filipinos. We have issued guidelines that apply to workplaces, employers, and workers,\" saad ni presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. \"As more sectors and industries begin to operate, let us continue cooperating with authorities in enforcing quarantine protocols. Let us take care of each other by wearing face masks/face shields, maintaining physical/social distancing, staying at home if/when need be and avoiding crowded places, and the like,\" dagdag pa niya. Hinikayat ni Roque ang publiko na tumulong sa tugon ng gobyerno laban sa COVID-19. \"The coronavirus disease 2019, as we have said, in numerous occasions, is an invisible enemy and the world, including the Philippines, has witnessed its adverse impacts across all sectors, as there is still no miracle cure or vaccine for this dreadful virus,\" ani Roque. \"The government cannot fight COVID-19 alone. We need the concerted effort of everyone. The sacrifices of our people in the past seventy or so days are laudable and we must not put these to naught,\" pahayag pa niya.
