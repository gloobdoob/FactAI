Ilan sa mga nabanggit ay ang matagumpay na War on Drugs at ang katapangang ipinakita niya laban sa China upang ipaglaban ang West Philippines Sea. Bukod sa pagiging magaling at matapang na presidente, kinilala rin si President Duterte sa pagiging magalang, tapat, at mabait, na hindi nagawa ng sinumang presidente sa kasaysayan ng mundo.
